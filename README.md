# school inventory (Link will follow)

Student: Sascha Klement

The inventory system is a comprehensive data processing and automation tool designed to assist a wide range of schools in managing, facilitating, and accelerating specific administrative and operational tasks, such as maintaining library records or handling supplies. It empowers school staff to add, update, search, display, or delete items from the respective records efficiently. As an international teacher, I understand that these tasks are crucial for the smooth day-to-day functioning of a school, which is often shaped by a multi-factorial set of dynamic conditions requiring staff to respond quickly and effectively to a variety of challenges. Therefore, automating key services and functionalities within such a fast-paced environment is essential to a school’s overall operational success and, ultimately, to the pupils it serves, particularly in the context of international education where adaptability and efficiency are of heightened importance.

# User Experience

## Background, Planning and Purpose:

The school inventory system provides staff with a clear and user-friendly way to automate recurring tasks such as managing library records and tracking supplies. By reducing the administrative load, teachers and administrators are able to devote more time to planning, instruction, and direct student support. With accurate data at hand, tasks such as monitoring stock levels, identifying missing items, calculating costs, and planning future purchases become far more manageable. Users can take informed decisions based on quantified, up-to-date information rather than memory or guesswork.

When planning this project, I wanted users to be able to:

add, update, search, display and delete existing items,

monitor product usage,

make informed decisions about restocking, and

access clear, colour-coded information for both library materials and general supplies.

Although a wide range of commercial school management systems exist, many of them are costly, overly complex for smaller institutions, or simply beyond the budget of schools with limited resources. My aim was to create a lightweight, low-cost data-automation tool that allows schools to benefit from basic digital management without requiring significant financial investment. Such an in-house solution can save time, reduce errors, and act as an accessible first step towards adopting more sophisticated digital systems in the future.

My own experience working across a variety of schools in Egypt made it clear that budget restrictions and, at times, hesitation toward new technologies can hinder more efficient organisational practices. This project is therefore designed as a practical, scalable solution that bridges that gap.
